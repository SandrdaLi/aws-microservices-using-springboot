This Step reference deployment guide provides instructions for deploying Linux bastion hosts in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. The Step also provides AWS CloudFormation templates that automate the deployment.

The guide is for IT infrastructure architects, DevOps engineers, and administrators who are building an AWS Cloud environment for their workloads and would like to securely deploy Linux bastion hosts to manage their deployments remotely.

The following links are for your convenience. Before you launch the this Step, please review the architecture, configuration, and other considerations discussed in this guide.

If you have an AWS account and you’re already familiar with AWS services, you can launch the Quick Start to build the architecture shown in Figure 1 in a new or existing Amazon VPC in your AWS account. The deployment takes approximately 5 minutes. If you’re new to AWS, please follow the step-by-step instructions provided later in this guide.

[NOTE]
If you want to take a look under the covers, you can view the AWS CloudFormation templates that automate the deployment. The templates include default settings that you can customize by following the instructions in this guide.

=== Build Script

Once your Bastion Host is ready, download the build script and install in your instance. This will prepare your instance for running tutorials in this workshop. The build script installs the following:

- jq
- kubectl _(the Kubernetes CLI, which we'll cover in great detail later in the workshop)_
- kops _(Kubernetes Operations, which we'll also cover in detail later)_
- configures the AWS CLI and stores necessary environment variables in bash_profile
- creates an SSH key
- clone the workshop repository into Bastion Host

To install the script, run this command in the "bash" terminal tab of the Bastion Host instance:

    aws s3 cp s3://aws-kubernetes-artifacts/lab-ide-build.sh . && \
    chmod +x lab-ide-build.sh && \
    . ./lab-ide-build.sh

[NOTE]
All shell commands _(starting with "$")_ throughout the rest of the workshop should be run in this tab. You may want to resize it upwards to make it larger.

At this point you can restart the Bastion Host instance terminal session to ensure that the kublectl completion is enabled. Once a new terminal window is opened, type `kubectl get nodes`. You do not have to run the command. It is normal for this command to fail with an error message if you run it. You have not yet created the Kubernetes cluster. We are merely testing to make sure the `kubectl` tool is installed on the command line correctly and can autocomplete.

One last step is required so that the Bastion Host instance uses the assigned IAM Instance profile. Open the "AWS Bastion Host" menu, go to "Preferences", go to "AWS Settings", and disable "AWS managed temporary credentials" as depicted in the diagram here:

You are now ready to continue on with the workshop!

The next step is link:../102-your-first-cluster[to create a Kubernetes cluster using kops].


== Workshop Cleanup

Once you have finished with the workshop, please don't forget to spin down your cluster or you will incur additional charges.
(We will also remind you at the end!)

==== Delete Kubernetes cluster resources

In your Bastion Host instance, check if there are any running kubernetes cluster

   $ kops get cluster

Delete kubernetes cluster

   $ kops delete cluster example.cluster.k8s.local --yes

Wait until all resources are deleted by kops

==== Delete Bastion Host Envionment

Go to CloudFormation console, right click template with name 'k8s-workshop' and select 'Delete Stack'

This should delete all the resources associated with this workshop


== Appendix: Manual Bastion Host Configuration

This appendix provides instructions for those who don't want to use the provided CloudFormation template, or who would like to configure Bastion Host manually.

AWS Bastion Host is only available in 5 regions currently. Please choose the region closest to you geographically.

|link:https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create[*Ohio* (us-east-2)]
|link:https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create[*Oregon* (us-west-2)]

|link:https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create[*Singapore* (ap-southeast-1)]
|===

Once there, follow these steps:

1. Provide a name for your environment.  Feel free to use something simple, such as `k8s-workshop`.  Then click "Next Step".

2. Change the "Instance Type" to `t2.small (2 GiB RAM + 1 vCPU)`.

3. Expand the "Network settings (advanced)" section and make sure you are using the default VPC.  It will have "(default)" next to the name.  If you do not have a default VPC listed, it is recommended that you create a "Single Public Subnet" VPC by clicking the "Create new VPC" button and following the wizard it presents.

4. If everything is correct, click the "Next Step" button.

5. Review the configuration to ensure everything is correct and then click the "Create environment" button.

This will close the wizard and you will be taken to a screen informing you that your new AWS Bastion Host environment is being created.  Once this is completed, the instance will open to the following screen:

Your environment is now ready to be setup for working with Kubernetes and the rest of this workshop.

=== Set up Environment

Your AWS Bastion Host environment comes with many useful tools preinstalled, but there are still a few tweaks to these and additional tools you will need to support working with Kubernetes.

=== Configure the AWS CLI

Your AWS Bastion Host environment comes with the AWS CLI preinstalled and configured to automatically use the credentials of the currently logged in user. Make sure you are logged in as a user with link:aws-permissions.adoc[these permissions.]

[NOTE]
*********************
It is not recommended that you change the default AWS CLI config in your AWS Bastion Host environment. Instead, it is recommended that you provide the logged in user's account the permissions needed to make any requests needed by your project.  More information on this can be found by visiting: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/credentials.html[Calling AWS Services from an Environment in AWS Bastion Host]
*********************

[NOTE]
All the commands below should be run in the Terminal section of your Bastion Host GUI.

=== Verify Docker Version

Docker is preinstalled.  You can verify the version by running the following:

    $ docker --version
    Docker version 17.06.2-ce, build 3dfb8343b139d6342acfd9975d7f1068b5b1c3d3

You should have a similar or newer version.

=== Install Kubectl CLI

Install the Kubectl CLI:

    $ curl -Lo kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.9.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl && chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

Add kubectl autocompletion to your current shell:

    $ source <(kubectl completion bash)

You can verify that kubectl is installed by executing the following command:

    $ kubectl version --client
    Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"9", GitVersion:"v1.9.2", GitCommit:"6e937839ac04a38cac63e6a7a306c5d035fe7b0a", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2017-09-28T22:57:57Z", GoVersion:"go1.8.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

=== Install kops

Install kops using the following:

    $ curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64
    $ chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
    $ sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops

=== Collect Availability Zones

kops needs to know the availability zones to use when configuring a cluster. We set an environment variable `$AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES` based on the region.

    $ export AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES="$(aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --query 'AvailabilityZones[].ZoneName' --output text | awk -v OFS="," '$1=$1')"

=== Configure an S3 bucket for kops

kops needs a "`state store`" to store configuration information of the cluster. We will use a s3 bucket with versioning enabled. A state store can work with multiple kops clusters.

[NOTE]
The bucket name must be unique otherwise you will encounter an error on deployment. We will use an example bucket name of `kops-state-store-` and add a randomly generated string to the end.

    $ export S3_BUCKET=kops-state-store-$(cat /dev/urandom | LC_ALL=C tr -dc "[:alpha:]" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | head -c 32)
    $ export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://${S3_BUCKET}
    $ aws s3 mb $KOPS_STATE_STORE
    $ aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket $S3_BUCKET --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

=== Clone the repository

The workshop repository has configuration files that are used to create Kubernetes resources.  You need to clone the repo to have access to those files:

    $ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes

At this point, you should have everything you need to complete any of the sections of the this workshop using your Bastion Host Environment.
